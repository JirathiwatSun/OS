### 🔗 Report Working Document
* **Link:** [ITCS225_Principles of Operating Systems_Report.docx](https://studentmahidolac-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jirathiwat_sun_student_mahidol_ac_th/IQDcoHgnUbmDRaAfFkPoq3rXAQrEiWEie7Wd9tKY8QHLqmk?e=iawVeG)

### 📌 General Guidelines & Format
* **File Type:** Complete your report in a word processing application and export it to submit as a **.PDF** file.
* **Cover Page Title:** Explicitly state the project title as **"Banking System"**.
* **Cover Page Team Info:** List every member's Student ID, First Name, Last Name, Nickname/Short Name, and their specific project role.

### 🛠️ Required Technical Content
* **Class Diagram:** Include your system's architecture, starting from the "interface" down to the specific modules and classes you implemented.
* **Runnable Java Code:** Insert all Java code in a clean text format. It must be highly readable and ready to be copy-pasted and run directly on the grading machine.
* **Memory Visualization:** Use an image, infographic, or visual layout to clearly trace each stack and heap call.

### ✍️ Explanations & Discussion
* **Unit #5 Tasks:** Clearly explain and discuss the 3 tasks assigned in the Unit #5 Lecture Notes.
* **Scheduling Concepts:** Detail the specific parts of your code that utilize scheduling to optimize performance on your platform (OS + environment).
* **Concurrency Concepts:** Explain the specific parts of your code that apply concurrency to optimize overall system performance.

> **⚠️ Note on Project Scope:**
> If your overall system design is too large for a 2-week development cycle, **please reduce the scope**. You do NOT need to complete all parts of your system design. Simply focus on building the main core components that allow you to effectively demonstrate and explain the 3 assigned tasks.
