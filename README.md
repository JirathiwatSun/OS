> **⚠️ Note on Project Scope:**
> If your overall system design is too large for a 2-week development cycle, **please reduce the scope**. You do NOT need to complete all parts of your system design. Simply focus on building the main core components that allow you to effectively demonstrate and explain the 3 assigned tasks.
